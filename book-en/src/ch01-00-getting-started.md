# Getting Started

Let’s start your OrbTK journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts
somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

* Installing OrbTK on Linux, Bsd, macOS, and Windows.
* Writing a basic OrtTK application that opens a windows placing `Hello OrbTK!` in its center.
* Using `cargo`, Rust’s package manager and build system.
