# The Orbital Widget Toolkit

*by Florian Blasius, with contributions from the Rust Community*

This version of the text assumes you’re using OrbTK v0.3.1 or later in
conjuction with Rust 1.41.0 or later.  *Cargo.toml* should define
`edition="2018"`. That enables and uses Rust 2018 Edition idioms in
all derived projects.

See the [“Installation” section of Chapter 1][install]
to install or update OrbTK.

The 2020 Edition of this book is the initial release. It will be
released with the OrbTK version 0.3.1.

- Appendix A “Keywords”, explains the new raw identifiers.
- Appendix D “Translations”, is work in progress. We will release
  instances of this book in the target language once they are translated.

For online reading, a HTML rendered version is available at [Orbtk
book_en][orbtk_book_en]. Alternatively you might want to have it handy
for offline usage. Either you downlaod a rendered `pdf` or
`ebook`version or go ahead and download the source. Then kick on
mdbook (the definition of the target location is optional).

```console
mdbook build --dest-dir doc/book_en --open
```
