## Installation

The first step is to install Rust. This is described in depth following
[Rust book Chapter 1](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/master/src/ch01-01-installation.md)

When creating a OrbTK application, we define the needed dependencies to the
OrbTK crates in the Cargo.toml file of our project. The complile process
will resolve the references and download the source as needed.

> ### Command Line Notation
>
> In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the
> terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with `$`. You
> don’t need to type in the `$` character; it indicates the start of each
> command. Lines that don’t start with `$` typically show the output of the
> previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific examples will use `>`
> rather than `$`.

### Troubleshooting

WIP:  list the most common culprit and provide some basic solutions

### Local Documentation

OrbTK offers the option to install its documentation locally, so you can read it
offline.

Any time a type, a function, a method or a crate is reference by the toolkit
and you’re not sure what it does or how to use it, have a look at its application
programming interface (API) documentation to find out!
