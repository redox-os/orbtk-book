# OrbTk Example Applications

This section provides `OrbTk` example apps. We hope to cover
interesting aspects of the toolkit.

Take them as a tutorial, all listings are created as a reference. They
have in mind to serve as an introduction to a specific topic. As
educational content, this apps are marked with in-lined comments and
anchors. If we did well, you can concentrate on the parts we like
to emphasize.

Inside the library, you will find the collection of example code in
the subdirectory *examples* in crate [`orbtk`][examples].

The `showcase` example serves a special purpose. It groups the
available widgets of the `orbtk_widgets` crate. Thus it will present a
collection of all available library templates, that you might consume
and extend in your own real world applications.
