`WIP`: The OrbTK core modules

## Application

The `application` crate provides the base api inside an `OrbTK` application.
Its elements are consumed via dedicated modules organized in the other sub-crates.

### The ContextProvider

This structure is a temporary solution to share dependencies inside an
`OrbTK` application. Right now, if the app is started, a new
`ContextProvider` object is created. The interconnection between
sender and receiver are handled using asynchronous channels with
sender/receiver halves (`mpsc`).

* window_sender
  A `WindowRequest` is used to send the given request to the named window.

* shell_sender A `ShellRequest` is used to send the given request to
	the application shell. The application shell is aware of the
	handled windows. They are differenciated via individual
	`WindowAdapter` objects.

In the given version this module isn't thread save. It will be
refactored in the next upcoming release.

### The WindowAdapter

Each `WindowAdapter` handles its unique tree, event pipiline and
shell. They are dynamically stored in the undelying `DCES` via **ECM**
methods.

The shell will react on UI events. The code for dedicated events are
organized in explicit modules that will trigger their handlers:

* activation events
* clipboard updates
* drop events
* focus events
* key events
* mouse events
* text input events
* window resize events
* window scroll events
* window system events (like `quit`)

The `EventAdapter` provides a thread safe way to push events to the
widget tree of a window.

### The Overlay widget

The `Overlay` widget allows the handling of children at the top of the
tree. Thus its children will be presented on top of all other widgets
grouped in the widget-tree.

## Layout

A `layout` is used to dynamically order the children of a
widget. Before we can arrange the components on screen, their sizes,
bounds and constraints have to be **measured**. The ordering process
will result in a parent / child relation (`tree`), that is represented
and handled in the **EMC**. In a next step, the tree components are
**arranged**. The result is rendered into an output buffer. Last not
least the updated areas are signaled to the output screen.

To measure components, the code will provide suitable defaults for
each property as well as a `desired_size`. The `desired_size` will
resolve the **height** and **width** property of the child element.
This values can either be overwritten with an **explicit** component
property inside your rust code, or while referencing to definitions
using a **style** property. Please take into account, that a given
**style** definition will take precedence over all explicitly defined
property elements inside the code. OrbTK will not respect a mixture of
both declarations.

### The absolute placement

Only components with a **visibility property** that is labeled with a
`Collapsed` or `Visible` option will be taken into account, when
calculating bounds and constraints of a child. The resulting bounds are
points, with absolute x and y positions on the screen (`floating point
values`).

New rendering of the child will only occur, if any of its properties is
marked `dirty`.

### The fixed size

A **fixed sized** layout is defined by fixed bounds for its
child. Think of images that have to be rendered with a given size, or
a minimum size of a text box.

### Grid layout

The **grid layout** is a specialized case of the default alignment
layout. If you declare **rows** and **columns**, the child blocks are
calculated suming up each individual block bounds inside the
corresponding row or column.

You may stretch the blocks to the choosen dimension (**horizontal**
vs. **vertical**). As a result, if you resize the window of the
running app, that grid element will consume the extra size available
because of your interactive change. Vice versa, the elements will
shrink down until the grid child will reach the defined minimum bound.

### Padding layout

Padding may be needed, as a property of a broad range of
components. The measurement cycle will calculate the padding value (a
**floating point** value) as a constraint that is added to the space
requirements of the associated content component. You may think of the
`padding` as a surrounding with a given thickness, that is placed
arround your content.

The following image visualizes the dependencies.

### Popup layout

The **popup layout** is a specialized case of the default alignment
layout. A popup is typically needed to render content, that is related
to a given target widget. That includes the position of the popup
itself, as well as its dynamic created content.

You can find a common use case of a popup if you study the OrbTK code
of a `list box`.  The list box elements are collected in a stack
widget. The `stack` itself is placed in a `popup` widget. And the
popup widget is placed right below the text block that offers a
drop-down selection arrow.

### Stack layout

The **stack layout** is a specialized case of the default alignment
layout. A stack offers a use case, where you want to place other
widgets in a congruent `horizontal` or `vertical` order.  You may
define a `spacing` property. This given floating point value is used
as a seperator between each stack member.

## Localization

Localization is a research task by itself, if you want to resolve all
syntactic rules that are found when writing prose in different
languages.  OrbTK's localization crate isn't ready to resolve all this
complexity, but this may improve in further releases.

Starting with the given implementation, `localization` can offer methods, that
are able to match and replace text strings. The usage of the `localization` crate is
optional. If you don't need any multi lingual adaptions inside your widgets, simply
do not include the `localization` sugar.

### The building blocks of localization

If you want to enable the users to select and change the desired display
language of the GUI at runtime, the toolkit needs to match up a requested
text strings (the key) that should be presented inside the view and substitute
it with the corresponding translation string (the target value). Dictionaries
are used to organize the keys as word lists.

OrbTK's `localization` implementation has choosen to persitently store
the translation strings inside a [`RON`][ron] file. When introducing
the new syntax structure used inside a `RON` filetype, it was one goal
of the authors to easily match rust types to ron types. That is
exactly the development goal from the RON authors:

  "RON is a simple readable data serialization format that looks
similar to Rust syntax. It's designed to support all of Serde's data
model, so structs, enums, tuples, arrays, generic maps, and primitive
values."

You can save each supported language in its individual ron file. The language
files need to be distinctable. A natural way to implement this requirement
is the usage of unique `language ids`. Most **operating systems* take advantage
of a `locale subsystem`, and save the identification of the active language in
the `lang` enviroment variable. It's good practice to include the language id in
the corresponding ron file name.

When you include the `localization` functionality in your OrbTK code, you
should define constants for each supported `language id`, that will reference the
ron file in question.

When calling the `RonLocalization` methods addressing the combination of a language
id and the corresponding dictionary you are able to store the result in `language`
variable. The crate methods will handle all the heavy lifting to substitute the
source values of the text attributes inside the views with their matching translation
strings in the addressed dictionary.

### The ron file structure

In OrbTK, the structure `RonLocalizationBuilder` is defined to take values for
the following parameters

* language: a String
* dictionaries: a HashMap

The ron filename representing a language localization should include the language
identifier to ease its distiction from another.

Dictionaries itself are stored
The dictionary is represended by a key value pair

A class `Dictionary` will include a `map` named **words**.
The ron type `map` is like a type `struct`, but keys are also values instead of
just beenig identifiers.

* using a ron file

Activation of the `localization` crate inside your source code boils
down to this short example code.

Filename: localization.rs

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch02-02-workspace-orbtk-core/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:Localization}}
```

We do define two language identifiers:

* _de_de: referencing a ron file with german translation strings
* _es_es: referencing a ron file with spanish translation strings

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch02-02-workspace-orbtk-core/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:Application}}
```
When creating the Application block, we do pipe in the localization property.
To keep this example simple, a hardcoded **de_DE** is choosen.
The [**showcase**][example_showcase] example inside the orbtk source code
implements a tab widget, that offers a dropdown list, to dynamically change
the active language variant.

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch02-02-workspace-orbtk-core/listing-02-01/src/main.rs:Language}}
```

To compile this example code, go ahead and enter the following comand
in your terminal window:

```console
$ cargo run --release orbtk_localization
```

Your screen should present an application window showing the translated spanish strings.

Sure, this code isn't elegant nor will it suite the real application
demands.  What it does show is the logic, to bind a ron file (storing
the translations of a given language) to a const. When calling
`RonLocalization`, the `text` method will resolve text attributes
inside a view or any rust primitive with the translation text resolved
in the language dictionary.
