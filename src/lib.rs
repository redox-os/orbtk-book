//! ![Welcome to the OrbTk planet.][orbtk_planet]
//!
//! This repository contains the text source for "The Orbital Widget Toolkit" book.
//! We will further reference to it as the `OrbTk-Book`.
//!
//! <!--
//!     WIP: once it is ready to be shipped
//!     [The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].
//!
//!     [nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/
//!
//!     You can read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
//!     the latest [stable], or [develop] OrbTk releases. Be aware that issues
//!     in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
//!     releases are updated less frequently.
//!
//!     [stable]: https://doc.orbtk.org/stable/book/
//!     [develop]: https://doc.orbtk.org/develop/book/
//!
//!     See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

//!
//! ## Requirements
//!
//! ### mdBook
//! Building the book requires [mdBook] and its helper tools. The used
//! version should be ideally the same that rust-lang/rust uses in
//! [this file][rust-mdbook]. Install this tools with:
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo install mdbook mdbook-linkchecker mdbook-mermaid
//! ```
//!
//! This command will grep the latest mdbook version from [crates.io] in
//! combination with the add-on tools mdbook-linkchecker and
//! mdbook-mermaid. With the linkchecker we are able to asure, that
//! the used links inside the markdown source can resolve to valid
//! targets. mkbook-mermaid is a preprocessor for mdbook to add
//! mermaid.js support. We do use it to create graphs that visiulize
//! some process flows.
//!
//! [crates.io]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-readme
//!
//! ### Multilingual version of mdBook
//! The OrbTk book aims to make translations as flawless as
//! possible. We are using v0.4.12 that will do the job. There is a
//! patch available that adds the needed salt to organize a book as a
//! multilingual structure: All sources stored in a single hirachical
//! code tree. This work isn't finished yet, but good enough to make
//! use of this branch for our productive needs. Thank you [Nutomic
//! and Ruin0x11][mdbook localization].
//!
//! You can force the installation of a given version number
//! with:
//!
//! ```
//! console $ cargo install mdbook --vers 0.4.12 mdbook-linkchecker mdbook-mermaid
//! ```
//!
//! ### Cargo handled README
//!
//! We do make uses of the crate [cargo-readme]. It resolves rust `doc
//! comments` to generate the README.md file you are reading now. Install the create
//! with the following command if you want to update or regenerate this README yourself.
//!
//! [cargo-readme]: https://github.com/livioribeiro/cargo-readme
//! [orbtk_planet]: https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk-book/blob/main/src/img/orbtk_planet.svg
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo install cargo-readme
//! ```
//!
//! Once the cargo-readme binary is available, you can render the
//! README.md. Change into the document-root and type:
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo readme > README.md
//! ```
//!

//!
//! ## Building
//!
//! ### Building the book
//!
//! To build the book with the default language (here: 'en'), change
//! into OrbTk-books root directory and type:
//!
//! ```console
//! $ mdbook build --dest-dir book/en
//! ```
//!
//! The rendered HTML output will be placed underneath the
//! `book/en` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in your web
//! browser.
//!
//! _Firefox:_
//! ```console
//! $ firefox book/en/html/index.html                       # Linux
//! $ open -a "Firefox" book/en/html/index.html             # OS X
//! $ Start-Process "firefox.exe" .\book\en\html\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
//! $ start firefox.exe .\book\en\html\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
//! ```
//!
//! _Chrome:_
//! ```console
//! $ google-chrome book/en/html/index.html                 # Linux
//! $ open -a "Google Chrome" book/en/html/index.html       # OS X
//! $ Start-Process "chrome.exe" .\book\en\html\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
//! $ start chrome.exe .\book\en\html\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
//! ```
//!
//! Executing `mdbook serve` will have **mdbook** act has a web service
//! which can be accessed opening the following URL:  http://localhost:3000.
//!
//! To run the tests:
//!
//! ```console
//! $ mdbook test
//! ```
//!
//! ### Building a language variant of the book
//!
//! Translated version of the book will be placed inside the code tree
//! in the subdirectory `src/<language id`.
//!
//! E.g. if you like to render the german version (language id: 'de'), change
//! into OrbTk-books root directory and type:
//!
//! ```console
//! $ MDBOOK_BOOK__src=src/de mdbook build --dest-dir book/de --open
//! ```
//!
//! The rendered HTML output will be placed underneath the
//! `book/de` subdirectory. Since we appended the `--open` parameter, your default browser should be fired up and ... tada!
//!

//!
//! We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
//! environment. Read more about our policy in the [code-of-conduct][coc] page.

//!
//! ### Translations
//!
//! We'd love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label
//! to join in efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new
//! issue to start working on a new language! We're waiting on [mdbook
//! support] for multiple languages to be finalized, but feel free to
//! start! A [pull request] looks promising. The mainline version (we
//! do depend on v0.4.12) is capable to render the existing versions
//! where sources are installed in the intended final structure.
//!

//! [pull request]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1306
//!
//! ## Spellchecking
//!
//! To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
//! script. It needs a dictionary of valid words, which is provided in
//! `dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false positive (say, you used word
//! `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid), you need to add this word to
//! `dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for consistency).
